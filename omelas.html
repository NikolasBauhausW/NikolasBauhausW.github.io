            “The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas” presents a unique and thought-provoking look on utilitarianism. It begs the question of whether utilitarianism would prevail if the cost was the acute suffering of one individual which everyone knows of. In the real world, the suffering that props up the first world is largely far-away and easy to ignore. From sweatshops in Bangladesh to child slaves working in cobalt mines, the facts are clear, but the suffering has not been observed by most people who benefit from it. In Omelas, the suffering is acute, and is, in fact, confined to one singular room where anyone can come to observe suffering first-hand. So the question is clear: <strong>would real-world citizens behave the same as those in Omelas if they could view, in one place, the combined suffering of all the people who prop up the first world? Would you?</strong>

            From the beginning, the story presents a boiled-down and polarized version of society. In the beginning, Ursula K LeGuin details the abundance of joy and exuberant attitude of the citizens of Omelas. There’s even an entire page where the author takes things to the extreme, essentially saying “whatever great joy and perfection you can think of (yes, even that one), it exists in Omelas”. While this is a hyperbole relative to the real world, I think that Ursula is intentionally creating as extreme a contrast as possible. The perfectly happy life of the citizens is starkly contrasted against the extremely disturbing suffering of the one child. Compare this to the real world, where the lines between privilege are for more gray, and there is much more to be distracted and confused by.

            Still, though, such extreme contrasts exist in the real world. From orphan kidnappings for organ harvesting to billion-dollar private mansions of dictators, the real world is not too different from Omelas. What differs is how easy it is for the common folk to lose sight of the suffering and inequality. Most people only think of their day-to-day activities and interests, which again, is an occurrence that can be compared to those in Omelas. Upon hearing of or seeing the suffering for the first time, most people are beyond perturbed. But as they grow older, they learn to forget and focus on the great privileges of their privileged lives. Just like in Omelas, they believe that they have to trade their happiness for the salvation of those in suffering, when in reality, all it would take is some awareness and action of the higher-ups.

            As a side note, an important issue that wasn’t addressed in Omelas but which I believe to be crucial, is how first-world citizens and corporations do a great deal of reassurance, so to speak. That is to say, many corporations and people believe that they are contributing to the betterment of the third world by buying “eco-friendly” and “made in US” products. While this may indeed help other issues, the problem remains that a large portion of our raw materials, goods, and labor are outsourced to other countries where human rights violations are occurring. This is just another distraction for those in privileged positions to feel good about themselves.

            Ultimately, Omelas is an extreme, albeit disturbingly accurate, analogy for the real world. Most people hear of the suffering, but forget quickly because it is “out of sight, out of mind”. That said, some outliers can’t stand the idea of profit from suffering. So they wander into the hills such that they may never be a part of the Omelas system again.
